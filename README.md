# Coding test
### Coding process
Package I used : requests、opencv、numpy   
+.First, use requests package to send the request to url that contains a img file.   
+.Second, use numpy to parse the byte string to numpy array that is a image data type.   
+.Finally, use opencv to flip the image and show the image.
It all the steps to complete this test.   
### How to use
If you want to try other image, just modify the url string.     
And you can save the image after comment out cv2.imwrite(".\image.jpg",getImage(url))
